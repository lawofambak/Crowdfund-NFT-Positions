# Crowdfund NFT Positions

## Introduction
This is a simple crowdfunding platform that lets users create, cancel, and claim from campaigns that have been created. When users pledge to campaigns, users receive an NFT that represents their pledged position rather than the crowdingfunding platform smart contract internally keeping data on the users (similar to Uniswap V3 LP NFT positions). This allows these pledged positions to be traded between different people.

## Problem -> Solution
I believe that NFT positions are more flexible in a way that it allows people to trade these positions. Also, the fact that users can receive NFTs allows users to keep better track of which campaigns they pledged to just by checking their wallets.

## How the project could evolve
This project is far from complete and is in the initial phase of being built and tested. The frontend is very minimal and just tests the basic functionalities of the smart contracts. Additionally, the NFT positions do not have any visual representation for users to see or view their NFTs.
